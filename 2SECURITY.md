<h1> Security Policy </h1>

I will track you down and murder you if you interfere with my website. <br> 
My relationship between my website and I is very much like john wicks with his dog. <br>
Try me if you dare.

<h2> Supported Versions </h2>

Security will be rolled out on the same update that the payment system is implenented <br>
to the website.


<h2> Reporting a Vulnerability </h2>

Unless it's anything to do with payment security, shut up and fuck off, loser.
