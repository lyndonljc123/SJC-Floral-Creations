<h1> SJC-Floral-Creations </h1>
<p> 
Hi all, this is my website for my mothers floristry business. The primary goal with the website is to gain new clientele. <br>
I hope to deploy the website by the end of August when I finish my coding bootcamp. To achieve this, it is of critical importance <br>
to have the enquiry forms submitting inputted data to my mothers email address. <br>
Everything on the WiKi page, other than completing the text, can be completed whenever.
</p>
<p> 
If there is a small amount of progress made daily, this will be easily achieveable. After the website is deployed, I will monitor <br>
the engagement. If there is a large amount of customers visiting the website without enquiring, we will need to prioritise improving <br>
the UI over everything else.
